the mouse is a slimy fellow <err targ=it's> its </err> not very big but it squeezes through tiny cracks in wood <err targ=it's> its </err> got very sharp teeth and a slimy tail and its little ears prick out of the hole it likes meal
the mouse
the mouse is a little fellow it lives amongst straw and sometimes a pile of bags or in any old heaps of rubbish etc

stephen asked me if i would like to go so he bought two tickets for him and me and we went in and pauline and trevor were sitting in there holding hands
so we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out and it was very dark in there then stephen was sitting there next to me and pauline said go on stephen hold judith's hand and after a while he did and he didn't let go of it until the film was over
the best boyfriend i ever had
<err targ=his> he's </err> father was posted
and so stephen left
but we still send letters and postcards to each other
so that we still remember each other
one fine morning i got up and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee but at my disaster i found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep so i grabbed it quick and brought it in it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes well of course i would have loved to keep the child but i knew that wouldn't be right so i telephoned the police and told them everything that had happened and told me to take the baby down to the police station
so i got ready and set off to the station
of course i liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the police
they said that they would put up notices about the baby
they let me look after him until someone owned up
a month later
a month went but nobody owned up and the police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said i could adopt the baby if i wanted to if not they would put it in a home
i soon got married and talked it over with my husband and he said it was ok with him so in a few <err targ=days'> day's </err> time the baby was ours and <err targ=weren't> were'nt </err> we pleased
so we all lived happily ever after

when three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags for me of course i went as red as beetroot but when i came back they called me again so after a while i went and picked it up i started talking to them every day
betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner they got lb of potatoes large tin beans and / lb ham and large peaches and large cream which all came to /- d when they got home the girls cooked the meal
they started out and the sea got deeper but it was lovely the sun was shining like a star glittering at night the sea was calm and bright as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea it was just like a dream which has come true
because <err targ=it's> its </err> night time and dark
because the wind is wild
because the two waves are a ring
it's where the sea has washed away the side of the rocks
the front of the boat where the sea ran up the beach
because there are trees in way there whispering to each other the sun is hot with wild animals roaming around
the beach is so hot and the sea is calm animals are roaming here and there

just a few lines to write about our english lesson with mr holbrook in the last months
he has taught us how to write good letters stories and poems
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years
but some work hasn't taught us a single thing we have to learn a fair bit of english to help us as we get older and out to work

well one of the cats meant to go outside but <err targ=something> somthing </err> happens he sees this hole and he puts his paw into the hole and the mice come up a little and they <err targ=grabbed> grabed </err> the cat
then it tried to get away but it was <err targ=no> know </err> use it was killed <err targ=then> they </err> they all came out and then they all were killed
then there was my mother and father and i came out of the house that night and saw that the cats were in the hole making a noise but we <err targ=couldn't> count </err> do anything about it because it was <err targ=too> to </err> late
but have got over it
my mother and father have been married for ten years and they have been happy ever since
when they started to meet
they said shall we go to the pictures and my mother said yes <err targ=we'll> well </err> do that said my mother it is a very good idea
but sometimes they have a fight they had a fight last night but they made friends again then when we went out last saturday afternoon they started to have a fight
my father shouted at my mother and <err targ=then> than </err> my mother shouted at my father then when my father went to the meeting we went to finish our shopping
when the children went out to play after dinner linda and i went on the field and sat down for a bit there were mary smith and linda and i linda said something (and then i went up to her and got on top of her and so we had a little play fight) but we are still friends with each other
we go together every day
i like her to come to guildwell some day but she said no she <err targ=can't> cant </err> there if she could she would come and see me and we would have good fun together and go up to the meadow and climb trees
went i went on my holiday i had a very nice time we played on the bikes and went shopping and when my auntie went to work but when she went work joan and derek started to have a quarrel but i did not take no notice of them and carried on what i was doing then joan said something to me but i did take notice of her and then she said i always <err targ=started> startes </err> a <err targ=quarrel> qurral </err> but when we were friends again
well on one saturday when my uncle <err targ=decided> desided </err> to go to the pictures with joan and derek well when they were in the pictures i was in a room watching bronco layne on t v
it was better than watching the film but i mean that bronco was very good
well when they came home that night i was still watching the t v
and derek and joan came in and said that my uncle was drunk and joan said that he nearly got run over and <err targ=also> als </err> joan had <err targ=guided> guard </err> him back to the house where was safe
well that same night when we were watching deadline-midnight my uncle came in and sat on a chair and watched part of the <err targ=programme> programe </err> and then came up and switched the t v <err targ=off> of </err> and <err targ=told> to </err> us to go to bed we ran upstairs and derek and i went into my bedroom so we stay in the room and i heard someone coming up the stairs so i went and i <err targ=peeped> peped </err> outside the door and saw that my uncle was coming up the stairs so i told derek so we went round the bed and i got on the bed and went straight down stairs and went into the <err targ=kitchen> kitchin </err> and told my auutie but she said that she <err targ=can't> cant </err> do anything about it so when he came downstairs again we went upstairs to bed
and when i was in bed i <err targ=listened> lisinid </err> out for my uncle because sometimes when he is drunk he comes up to my room door but not always but it stopped me from going to sleep because <err targ=sometimes> sometime </err> he gives me the <err targ=creeps> creaps </err> but before then he very nearly hit derek and i but i <err targ=don't> dont </err> know what for and then we went to bed and went to sleep but when they all were asleep my uncle got up and came out of the room and went downstairs i <err targ=don't> dont </err> know what he was up to but still i kept awake a very long time because i <err targ=wasn't> wasnt </err> tired so i stayed awake for a while and when he came upstairs and stood outside my door i got a bit scared because i thought he was going to come in my room so i kept so still and quiet and a bit later he went into his own room and got in bed and went to sleep and he woke my auntie she was awake for a little while and then she was asleep in a <err targ=no> know </err> time and i couldn't go to sleep at all but still i kept awake to listen out for my uncle just in case he came into my room but a bit later on i fell <err targ=off> of </err> to sleep and i got nice and warm

sir
mr t says mr holbrook is <err targ=too> to </err> soft with us by not teaching us spellings
i agree with mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell i am the best speller in c and do not find some words <err targ=difficult> differcult </err> but people who get under find words very <err targ=difficult> differcult </err>
if you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school
i think mr holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so i think it is essential that we should write properly
i have written a lot of stories in the term i have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so i find it quite easy

sir
mr t says that mr holbrook our english teacher is too soft and <err targ=doesn't> does'nt </err> teach us very good english but i don't believe one word of it it is <err targ=absolutely> absolutly </err> nonsense he is a good enough teacher for any child to learn from
we write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them
mr t said it will be be harder for us when we leave school but if we <err targ=concentrate> consantrate </err> and <err targ=listen> listern </err> to what we are told in english we will have no trouble when we go out into the world
when we write stories i think the story is much more important than the spellings and <err targ=punctuation> puntuation </err>
yours faithfully judith
when we have mr holbrook we have to write a story and sometimes we write pages or more and we plenty of the idea <err targ=you're> your </err> <err targ=thinking> tinking </err> of
jack o'malley
we have to work hard and it <err targ=takes> tacks </err> hard work to write <err targ=these> thoese </err> <err targ=stories> story </err> and it very hard when people say he soft on us
joan stall
i think mr t <err targ=should> shoold </err> come and see mr
holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a <err targ=form> frame </err> magazine
