pigs when young up to being killed for bacon
when they are young you have to wait days then you can <err targ=inject> injeck </err> them for pneumonia diseases
you have make sure they have <err targ=dry> drye </err> straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a fork in with them because the mother might <err targ=knock> nock </err> it down and the little pigs might stab themselves
we give <err targ=them> the </err> <err targ=worm> worme </err> <err targ=powder> pouder </err>
that is when they get the <err targ=worm> worme </err>
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can <err targ=get> ge </err> out of the way of their mother
some people put a light in with <err targ=them> theme </err> to <err targ=keep> geep </err> them warm
you have to make sure that mother has a lot of milk
if she <err targ=has> as </err> not got enough milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they can eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts for fattening
they can <err targ=eat> eate </err> some meal when they get a little <err targ=bigger> biger </err>
we give them some fattening food called nomber
<err targ=when> whe </err> you wean that is take them from their mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little <err targ=ones> wones </err>
fighting
when they are <err targ=big> bing </err> you have to see about weighing
when they have been weighed and <err targ=ready> reddy </err> to go away to be killed

there were some brussels men sitting in the pathway round a fire
we had to go on to a ploughed field to get round them this made my shoes heavy
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did i but we still went
the dew on the brussels leaves made them like pearls
